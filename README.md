# Bell Schedule

A (much needed) clean bell schedule web application for Harker students

## Usage
### Stable Version
* Go to [the Github IO page](http://harkerdev.github.io/bellschedule/) to access the schedule
* Click the left and right arrows to switch between weeks
* Periods are highlighted as the day progresses
* Time left until the current period is over is displayed in small, bold text underneath the general period title

### Dev Version
* **Note: the development version is unstable and may have unintended sideeffects in runtime**
* [Download](https://github.com/HarkerDev/bellschedule/archive/master.zip) the current version of the code
* Extract the ZIP file to any directory on your computer
* In the extracted folder, open the index.html file in a browser of your choice (we recommend Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome)
* The schedule will run in your browser until you close the tab

## To Do
Bold tasks are currently being worked on.
* doge mode
* ~~options~~
 * update checking for new versions (offline support too)
 * suspend updateInterval while tab is not visible; updateSchedule when tab is changed to vissible
 * improve handling different resolutions
 * better touchscreen support? (can't read tooltips)
 * show only current day (mainly useful for phones)
 * changelog tab
* ~~"back to this week" button~~
 * ~~Hide on current week~~
 * Integrate better with change week buttons (somehow)
 * Switch away from buttons
* **Parse PDF files for bell schedules and automatically update schedule**
 * Fix PDF Parser (test with correct formatting and modify code)
