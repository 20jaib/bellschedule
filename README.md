# Bell Schedule

A clean bell schedule web application for Harker students

## Usage
* Go to [the Github IO page](http://harkerdev.github.io/bellschedule/) to access the schedule
* Click the left and right arrows to switch between weeks
* Periods are highlighted as the day progresses
* Time left until the current period is over is displayed in small, bold text underneath the general period title

## To Do
Bold tasks are currently being worked on.
* doge mode
* ~~options~~
 * update checking for new versions (offline support too)
 * suspend updateInterval while tab is not visible; updateSchedule when tab is changed to vissible
 * ~~improve handling different resolutions~~
 * better touchscreen support? (can't read tooltips)
 * **show only current day (mainly useful for phones)**
* ~~"back to this week" button~~
 * ~~Hide on current week~~
 * Integrate better with change week buttons (somehow)
 * Switch away from buttons
* **Parse PDF files for bell schedules and automatically update schedule**
 * Fix PDF Parser (test with correct formatting and modify code)
